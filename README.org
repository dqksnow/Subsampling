* Meeting summary


*** To do list
softmax need ... to pass arguments to fitting function
for quantile, test alpha in example, add alpha to test function.

- Jun 12:
- [X] rename variables. For example, 'Uniform' should be moved from argument

  'likelihood' which contains c('Weighted', 'MSCLE').

- [X] Environment variables (e.g. X, Y, N, n.plt) should be stored in a list for
  input to build-in functions. This makes the main function look clean. Make
  sure it won't copy those variables.

** Jun 26
- Environment variables (e.g. X, Y, N, n.plt) should be stored in an object for
  input to build-in functions. R is copy-on-modify. Copying is done only when
  objects are modified. An example:
  
  > X <- rnorm(1e6)
  
  > Y <- rnorm(1e6)
  
  > X_list <- list(X=X)
  
  > XX <- X_list$X
  
  > tracemem(X) # address of X
  
  [1] "<0x119f18000>"
  
  > tracemem(X_list$X)
  
  [1] "<0x119f18000>"
  
  > tracemem(XX)
  
  [1] "<0x119f18000>"
  
  > model <- lm(Y~XX)
  
  > tracemem(XX)[1] "<0x119f18000>"
  
  > XX[1] <- 1
  
  tracemem[0x119f18000 -> 0x10ef20000]:
  
  > tracemem(XX)
  
  [1] "<0x10ef20000>"
  
  > tracemem(X)
  
  [1] "<0x119f18000>"
  
  > tracemem(X_list$X)
  
  [1] "<0x119f18000>"

** May 29
*** Discussion Points
- For quantile regression, since the total subsample size is n.ssp*B, we should
  give a warning if the user assigned subsample size is too large.
- Try poisson sampling.

** Apr 24
*** Discussion Points
- Since equation (65) in MSCLE paper is the same as equation (5) in
  OSMAC paper, we can just use K column matrix and premultiply L
  instead of using (K+1) column matrix in the code.  OptA and OptP
  should also be implemented in this way.

** Apr 10
*** Discussion Points
- Check whether the results from 'nnet:multinom' match our 'getMSLE'.
- When calculate the offset term log(pi), we should use exact sampling
  probability pmin(pi, 1) rather than pi. In this case, we can't use
  the specific form of Lopt anymore. We should write a new function to
  calculate this offset term.
   
** Mar 27
*** Discussion Points
- When implement MSCLE, I find that 'nnet:multinom' may not use the offset
  term as we want. I will try to figure it out and write getMSLE by hand as
   a comparison.


** Mar 20
*** Discussion Points
- Fix (n.plt+n.ssp) and then enlarge n.plt so that \(Var(\hat{\beta}_{cmb} -
   \beta_{true})\) should be close to \(Var(\hat{\beta}_{plt} - \beta_{true})\)
   . The simulation results show that it meets expectation except when n.plt
    and n.ssp are both large. Try to use degree of freedom to correct.

- Implement MSCLE. First implement OptL.

** Mar 6
*** Discussion Points
- Since \(Var(\hat{\beta}_{plt} - \beta_{true})\) and \(Var(\hat{\beta}_{ssp}
  - \beta_{true})\) work well, we should double check the calculation of
    \(Var(\hat{\beta}_{cmb} - \beta_{true})\). Simulation strategy: fix
    (n.plt+n.ssp) and then enlarge n.plt so that \(Var(\hat{\beta}_{cmb} -
     \beta_{true})\) should be close to \(Var(\hat{\beta}_{plt} -
      \beta_{true})\).

** Feb 21
*** Discussion Points
- When calculating \(Var(\hat{\beta}_{plt} - \beta_{true})\), I forgot to add a
   term to correct its difference with \(Var(\hat{\beta}_{plt} -
   \beta_{full})\). As a result, this term is missed in the calculation of
    \(Var(\hat{\beta}_{cmb} - \beta_{true})\). Check this problem in softmax
     code and previous code.

- Implement MSCLE with the assistance of the Julia code. First implement OptL.
