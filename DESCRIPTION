Description: For common statistical models such as glm and
    quantile regression model, draw subsamples from full dataset by different optimal
    subsampling criterion and estimate coefficients and covariance matrix
    based on the subsample. When developing statistical models on massive
    datasets, subsampling is effective to reduce computational burden and
    optimal subsampling methods can improve estimation efficiency.
